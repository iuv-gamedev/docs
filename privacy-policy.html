    <p>Thank you for playing our game(s)! This Privacy Policy applies to all games developed and published by <strong>IUV GameDev</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”) and outlines how we handle your privacy when you play our games.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal information directly from users. However, we use third-party services such as <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to show advertisements, which may collect data automatically for ad targeting and analytics purposes.</p>
